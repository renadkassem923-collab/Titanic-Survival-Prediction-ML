# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-ML
Machine Learning project for predicting survival on the RMS Titanic dataset using Python.
# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning

This is an academic machine learning project developed at college using Python to predict passenger survival on the RMS Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview
The project applies and compares multiple classification algorithms to analyze the effect of different passenger features such as age, gender, class, fare, and family size on survival outcomes.

## Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature analysis
- Train-test split (80% training / 20% testing)
- Model training and comparison
- Performance evaluation

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning (Classification)
